1. Which parts of the code you provided would need to be adapted to run the same
tests in an Android phone, using the same browser, in the tool you chose?

1. Initialize android driver
2.Add desired capabilities  and also add browser as capability lrtjh
3. You have to adapt the below code to run the WEB UI tests in Android.The example is of Appium

    
		//Initialize Browser 
		setupDriver(browserName);
		// Maximize Window
		driver.manage().window().maximize();
		//delete cookies
		driver.manage().deleteAllCookies();
		// Get Url 
		driver.get(Constants.url);
		//Set Implicit wait for 20 sec
		driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

2. How could we run these tests in a physical android phone connected to your laptop?
Does the laptop need any extra software/hardware to run them properly?


3. What would be the main changes if the website was now part of a hybrid android
app?

Appium comes with built-in hybrid support via Chromedriver

It is necessary to set true the setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled property on the android.webkit.WebView element.

add capabilities and initialize android driver

SET CONTEXT TO WEB_VIEW

Set<String> contextNames = driver.getContextHandles();
for (String contextName : contextNames) {
    System.out.println(contextName); //print all the context
}
driver.context(contextNames.toArray()[id of web view]);

4. And if it was a native app?

a. Add appPackage and Appactivity in desired capabilitiesk;k'
